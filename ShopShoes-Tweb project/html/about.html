            <p>I’m Michele Merico, founder of Shop Shoes. The idea was born during a university exam and since then I have decided to create all this. I was able to take away various satisfactions and I hope that all this can continue for a long time.
                My intent is to expand this online shop even more so that I can, perhaps later, open the first physical store.
                I have had many people who have joined me in this journey and I will never stop thanking them as I will never stop thanking those who continue to choose me and us every day.
                Now go on shopping, I’ve already written too much.
